# HMM Part-of-Speech Tagger ✍️

A Python implementation of a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** for **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**, trained on labeled text data and evaluated on unseen sentences using the **Viterbi algorithm**.

## 📖 About the Project

**POS tagging** assigns syntactic roles (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence.  
This project builds an HMM to model POS tagging, where:  
- **Hidden states** = POS tags  
- **Observations** = words in the sentence  

The HMM uses three learned probability tables:
1. **Initial Probabilities**: Likelihood of a POS tag starting a sentence  
2. **Transition Probabilities**: Likelihood of one POS tag following another  
3. **Observation Probabilities**: Likelihood of a word being generated by a POS tag  

The model predicts the most likely sequence of tags for unseen text, resolving ambiguity with contextual inference.

## ⚙️ Features

- Learns probabilities from training files with text-tag pairs  
- Predicts POS tags for untagged sentences using the **Viterbi algorithm**  
- Handles **unseen words** with fallback strategies (frequency-based, position-based, or contextual estimation)  
- Supports **ambiguity tags** (e.g., `VVD-VVN`) with consistent handling  
- Achieves >90% accuracy on test cases when well-trained  
- Efficient enough to run within 5 minutes on large test sets
